## Tribalism in American Politics

In the last couple of decades, there has been a growing sense of a widening chasm in American politics where the divide is defined more by regional demographics and cultural identity than simply a difference of opinion regarding public policy. This dysfunctional political landscape is now so widely acknowledged that Geoff Nunberg of NPR’s “Fresh Air” radio program declared “tribalism” the word of 2017 [@NunbergFissuresPoliticalCamps].

Because there is an explicit “winner” and “loser” in each election, there is a natural propensity for voters to adopt an “us” versus “them” mentality. Further, an individual is much more likely to be influenced by their geography, class, friends, and family when supporting a candidate as opposed to their own political ideals. Upon identifying with a particular party, the political divide is further entrenched by social media and preferred news outlets that validate and reinforce their party’s rhetoric. As a consequence, Andrew Sullivan of the Washington Post describes the two tribes in American politics as “fighting not just to advance their own side but to provoke, condemn, and defeat the other” [@SullivanCanOurDemocracy2017].  Robert Reich, the Chancellor’s Professor of Public Policy at University of California at Berkeley, more strongly asserts that both the Republican and Democratic parties “are pulling America apart, often putting tribal goals over the national interest” [@ReichNewTribalismDecline].

Most tools that aim to empower the American voter focus on boosting voter turnout or rallying support for a particular party, concern, or politician. However, the United States will likely continue this trend of “mutual incomprehension” and acrimony without an effort to improve the way we communicate with each other regarding important issues impacting the nation. The Civil Discourse web app aspires to be an interactive tool that reintroduces human complexity into our political system [@GersonOpinionTribalismtriumphs2017] and allow the user to view members of an opposing political group as unique individuals as opposed to hostile outsiders. By focusing on commonalities and obfuscating party lines, Civil Discourse intends to introduce nuance and respect to our nation's dialogue.

## Prioritizing Political Ideals

Just as the "Big Five" personality model [@costa_revised_1992] & [@norman_toward_1963] aims to represent how a person engages with the world, the Civil Discourse web app will create a *political* profile of current American congressmen and senators based on their position on previous legislation. An initial dataset, with each bill rated according to its relevance to a set of ideals such as immigration, social insurance, individual rights & freedoms, taxation, energy, and military, will be used as input for a machine learning model that will predict a politician’s position on each of these areas depending on their voting record.

A user of the Civil Discourse web app will specify the political party he/she currently identifies with and answer a series of questions that will produce a political profile of the individual. Instead of matching the user with a politician that is most congruent overall with his/her own views as is often done, the Civil Discourse web app will list politicians from other parties with similar weights on the distinct ideals that were emphasized most strongly on the user’s political profile along with summaries of specific bills the politician supported and talking points relevant to the matching ideal.

## Leveraging the Affect Heuristic

There are two desired outcomes from using the Civil Discourse web app. The user will 1) focus on commonalities between parties to speak more respectfully regarding differences & 2) vote for a politician based on voting record as opposed to rhetoric. For example, a politician may claim to support the military but then fail to support a measure that would continue paying military personnel during a government shutdown.

In many ways, the dynamic between America’s two major political parties is similar to that of a broken marriage. The focus has shifted from wanting to solve the nation’s problems to winning at all costs. There are a number of cognitive biases that contribute to this problem, and it is likely that those that are already open-minded to differing viewpoints will be attracted to this tool. One such cognitive bias, the affect heuristic, encourages the political divide by simplifying our lives into an overly tidy framework. However, the Civil Discourse web app will leverage that same cognitive bias in a positive way by presenting compatible viewpoints from politicians of a different party in hopes of changing the "emotional appeal" of that group to the user [@kahneman_thinking_2011].
