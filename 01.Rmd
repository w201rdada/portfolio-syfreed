## Ideology versus Identity Voting Behaviour

An individual's geography, culture, friends, and family are much more likely to influence whether or not an American supports a particular political candidate as opposed to the candidate's voting record, even if the candidate has historically voted against the individual's interest.

## Strip the Identity from Politics

Just as the "Big Five" personality model (Costa & McCrae, 1992, and Norman, 1963) aims to represent how a person engages with the world, the Civil Discourse platform will create a *political* profile of a user based on how they prioritize the importance of a given set of political ideologies without regard for party affiliation. The user will then similarly rate a number of bill summaries based on how they perceive the contents of the bill is relevant to the previously established political ideology criteria. These bills and their corresponding user ratings will serve to train a natural language processing model to assign political ideology weights to a much broader set of legislation or any future bills. It will then be possible to create a political profile for politicians based on their voting record and the political ideology weights assigned to the legislation they support.

## Informed Voting

By participating in the Civil Discourse platform, the user will be able to determine how congruent a given political candidate is to their own values based on their voting record as opposed to their personality or brand.
