	abstract = {The current study investigated the extent to which outpatient psychotherapy clients benefited from Pennebaker's expressive writing protocol (Pennebaker \& Beall, 1986) adapted for use as a homework intervention. Participants were randomly assigned to written emotional disclosure or writing control conditions. Pre- and postintervention outcome measures were collected for three consecutive therapy sessions. Clients in the written emotional disclosure group showed significantly greater reductions in anxiety and depressive symptoms as well as greater overall progress in psychotherapy in comparison to the writing control group. Results suggest that emotional disclosure writing homework, in conjunction with outpatient psychotherapy, facilitates therapeutic process and outcome.},

	abstract = {This updated edition adds some new definitions of the emotions, new developments in emotional theory, selected additional references, and a new preface. In its basic volume it outlines in detail a model of primary emotions and their mixtures. It also examines the various problems that have plagued research in this area and shows how the model helps to resolve and clarify these issues. Using material from both psychoanalytic and behavioristic sources, as well as other theoretical viewpoints, this book remains a very comprehensive and valuable study.

Some prior research efforts in this area are briefly reviewed and evaluated. Results of a series of studies are presented which employed primarily groups of university male Ss who varied in length and intimacy of previous associations. Data were obtained using peer nomination rating methods. These analyses yielded clear and consistent evidence for the existence of 5 relatively orthogonal, easily interpreted personality factors. Behavioral correlates of selected patterns of scores on these factors are briefly discussed and suggestions are made concerning subsequent research efforts warranted by these findings.
