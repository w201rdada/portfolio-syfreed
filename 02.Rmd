## Unreliable Narrators and Sparse Sampling

In general, mental health practitioners must rely heavily on the self-reporting of patients to gauge the efficacy of therapy or prescribed medication. However, a patient's assessment of their own progress can be influenced by their state at the time of their appointment, and the nature of their condition may further alter their self-perception.

## Metrics and Trends from Journaling

Journaling is a common recommendation in cognitive behavioural therapy for patients to process their thoughts and emotions, but this type of qualitative data can be further leveraged. Daily electronic journal entries of patients can be used as an input for sentiment analysis that outputs metrics and trends that would supplement a doctor's or therapist's judgement and expertise in the treatment of their patient. The most basic type of metric would be the change in the number of positive or negative markers. However, the sentiment analysis can provide further insight on a range of emotions by using a model such as Plutchik's wheel of emotions.

## Empower Doctors and Therapists

Instead of relying on brief windows of observation during a patient's appointment that may provide more insight into their momentary state rather than their overall well-being, doctors and therapists can use the metrics derived from the sentiment analysis of daily journal entries to make decisions regarding a change in medication or therapy approach.
