Once defined, you can reuse me simply by writing (ref:abs1) where you want this text to go. Keywords politics, democracy, vote, elections, cognitive bias, tribalism 1.1 Tribalism in American Politics In the last couple of decades, there has been a growing sense of a widening chasm in American politics where the divide is defined more by regional demographics and cultural identity than simply a difference of opinion regarding public policy. This dysfunctional political landscape is now so widely acknowledged that Geoff Nunberg of NPR’s “Fresh Air” radio program declared “tribalism” the word of 2017 (Nunberg 2018). Because there is an explicit “winner” and “loser” in each election, there is a natural propensity for voters to adopt an “us” versus “them” mentality. Further, an individual is much more likely to be influenced by their geography, class, friends, and family when supporting a candidate as opposed to their own political ideals. Upon identifying with a particular party, the political divide is further entrenched by social media and preferred news outlets that validate and reinforce their party’s rhetoric. As a consequence, Andrew Sullivan of the Washington Post describes the two tribes in American politics as “fighting not just to advance their own side but to provoke, condemn, and defeat the other” (Sullivan 2017). Robert Reich, the Chancellor’s Professor of Public Policy at University of California at Berkeley, more strongly asserts that both the Republican and Democratic parties “are pulling America apart, often putting tribal goals over the national interest” (Reich 2018). Most tools that aim to empower the American voter focus on boosting voter turnout or rallying support for a particular party, concern, or politician. However, the United States will likely continue this trend of “mutual incomprehension” and acrimony without an effort to improve the way we communicate with each other regarding important issues impacting the nation. The Civil Discourse web app aspires to be an interactive tool that reintroduces human complexity into our political system (Gerson 2017) and allow the user to view members of an opposing political group as unique individuals as opposed to hostile outsiders. By focusing on commonalities and obfuscating party lines, Civil Discourse intends to introduce nuance and respect to our nation’s dialogue. 1.2 Prioritizing Political Ideals Just as the “Big Five” personality model (Costa, McCrae, and Psychological Assessment Resources 1992) &amp; (Norman 1963) aims to represent how a person engages with the world based on five generalized personality traits, the Civil Discourse web app will create a political profile of current American congressmen and senators based on their position on previous legislation. First, a core set of political ideals will be identified and defined, such as limited government, equality, social insurance, individual rights &amp; freedoms, the environment, and foreign policy. Since ideals are a social construct, an initial dataset will consist of a random sampling of past bills that are manually rated and classified according to their relevance to the previously defined ideals based on the human interpretation of several individuals. A natural language processing model will then be designed using the initial, manually classified training set to assign weights for each defined political ideal to a larger, more comprehensive set of legislation as well as any new bills that are voted upon. By aggregating the model weights of each bill that a politician supports or opposes as evident by his voting record, a profile can be produced to score a politician’s position on each stance. In a similar manner, an American voter visiting the Civil Discourse web app can create his or her own political profile by completing a questionnaire analogous to how someone may take an online personality test. In addition, the user will specify his or her political party as an input. This may seem counter-productive to the tool’s goal of overcoming division. However, the intent is to highlight compatible viewpoints from politicians of a political group that is different from the user’s own party. Often, a tool of this type will narrow the focus of the user to match him or her with the political candidate that is the best overall match to their political disposition. In contrast, the Civil Discourse app will broaden the perspective of the user to consider politicians that may not have the political profile most congruent with the user but may strongly support or oppose a common stance that is weighted highly on the user’s results. The goal is to regard politicians on a political spectrum as opposed to a binary categorization. The end product will be a political profile of the user, similar to a personality profile, along with a list of three politicians from an opposing party that share a strong conviction on a matching ideal. The user can then interact with the results to explore which policies the listed politicians supported or opposed that weighted them similarly to the user on that stance. In addition, the user will be encouraged to share their results on social media, such as Facebook or Twitter, so that their friends and family can use the tool for their own introspection. 1.3 Leveraging the Affect Heuristic There are two desired outcomes from using the Civil Discourse web app. The user will 1) focus on commonalities between parties to speak more respectfully regarding differences &amp; 2) vote for a politician based on voting record as opposed to rhetoric. For example, a politician may claim to support the military but then fail to support a measure that would continue paying military personnel during a government shutdown. In many ways, the dynamic between America’s two major political parties is similar to that of a broken marriage. The focus has shifted from wanting to solve the nation’s problems to winning at all costs. There are a number of cognitive biases and human tendencies that contribute to this problem. Tribalism is seductive because it feels good to belong to a group and it is easier to adopt the tribe’s opinions than it is to wade through the complexities of public policy. This automatic assumption of a simpler attribute in place of a more computationally demanding judgment is a classic substitution bias. Another cognitive bias, the affect heuristic, impacts the individual in this context in a number of ways. Paul Slovic defined the affect heuristic as the tendency “in which people let their likes and dislikes determine their beliefs about the world”. It eases the effort required to make a decision or form an opinion by creating an overly simplistic framework of reality where an individual will overemphasize the qualities of things he or she may like and readily dismiss the things he or she may dislike. However, Slovic’s research team found in a study that the affect heuristic could be overcome simply by having the subjects read arguments in favour of a technology they previously viewed negatively. In a similar manner, the Civil Discourse web app will leverage that same cognitive bias in a positive way by presenting compatible viewpoints from politicians of a different party in hopes of changing the “emotional appeal” of that group to the user (Kahneman 2011).

However, a patient’s assessment of their own progress can be influenced by their immediate state at the time of their appointment, and the nature of their condition may further alter their self-perception. In addition, doctors and therapists usually only see their patients once a week or even more infrequently. This may cause aliasing when trying to determine trends or patterns in patient behaviour or symptoms. Journaling is a common recommendation in cognitive behavioural therapy for patients to process their thoughts and emotions. In a study investigating the effectiveness of expressive writing in outpatient psychotherapy, the individuals in the written emotional disclosure group demonstrated significant improvement in their anxiety and depression compared to the control group (Graf, Gaudiano, and Geller 2008). Often, the action of journaling itself is emphasized as therapeutic for the patient, but the qualitative data from the resulting journal entries can potentially provide further insight into the patient’s emotional state at a much finer frequency than appointments alone. By using a natural processing model combined with a therapist or doctor’s expert observations to obtain emotional metrics from daily journal entries, a mental health professional can monitor the progress of their patient more reliably. 2.2 Metrics and Trends from Journaling For this project to be successful, we must understand how changes in mental and emotional health are reflected in an individual’s writing. To investigate this question, we must acquire a dataset that includes a collection of writing from individuals based on a standard set of prompts that are qualitatively classified by experts according to a model of emotions, such as Plutchik’s wheel of emotions. Dr. Robert Plutchik defined four sets of opposing emotions: joy and sadness, trust and disgust, fear and anger, as well as surprise and anticipation. The combinations of the primary emotions as well as the change in intensity result in new emotional categories. For example, the combination of joy and anticipation yields optimism, and an increase in intensity transforms sadness to grief (Plutchik 1991). This initial classified dataset can then be used to train a natural language processing model that will be the foundation for the proposed product, which will accept daily electronic journal entries of patients. The outputs of the model will include weights for general positive and negative sentiments as well as for categories of emotions identified in the writing. The deployment of the model will involve building a secure web app with two main components: a patient facing interface for writing journal entries that will become the model inputs and a dashboard for mental health professionals that will display metrics and trends derived from the model outputs. Absolute metrics on individual journal entries, such as emotion weights, may be of limited value. However, relative trends or the change over time in each metric for an individual patient may be more insightful. For example, the model outputs for a particular journal entry may specify 80% apprehension and 20% interest. The heavy proportion of apprehension expressed in the writing may be alarming out of context. However, this may be close to the baseline for the patient. A more significant finding would be if the proportion of apprehension was a result of an increasing trend that was not deterred by treatment. During patient appointments, doctors will have the opportunity to compare model outputs with their own expert judgement. If there is a significant difference, they can correct the results which will then be used to calibrate the model for future runs. Expert diagnoses and patient data are anonymized and used to augment the main model to increase robustness with use. 2.3 Empower Doctors and Therapists Instead of relying on brief windows of observation during a patient’s appointment with their mental health professional, doctors and therapists can use the quantitative metrics and trends from the sentiment analysis of daily journal entries to augment their expertise and make more informed decisions regarding changes in medication or therapy strategies. In addition, access to data on a daily scale prevents the possibility of being overly influenced by anomalously low or high symptoms at the time of a patient’s appointment. The content of the journal entries would only be accessible to the patient as well as his or her mental health professional and would be respected by the same confidentiality between patient and doctor as the content of in-person appointments. Since the journal is shared with the doctor or therapist, the patient may censor their writing just as he or she may not be completely forthright while answering questions during an appointment. However, the natural language processing model may identify subtle patterns in word choice or structure that are clues to the inner state of the patient which may not be otherwise apparent to the doctor. In the future, additional types of monitoring data, such as heart rate, may be integrated to provide mental health professionals with a more holistic view of their patients. Alternative forms of monitoring data may be essential in circumstances where journaling may be harmful to the patient or where there are problems with patient adherence to medical advice. The end goal is to provide tools and guidance that allow for more consistent diagnosis and monitoring of mental illness, regardless of the variance in intuition amongst mental health professionals or the ability of the patient to accurately report their condition.
